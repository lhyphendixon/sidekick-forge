## Sidekick Forge v2.6.5 (staging)

Key UI/UX updates (Jan 16, 2026):
- Admin Users now supports search with pagination (20 per page) while respecting scoped client access, making large tenant lists manageable.
- Admin navigation is locked to superadmins; sidekick cards get a new hero-style layout that highlights client badges, descriptions, and embed/preview actions with agent images as backgrounds.
- Sidekick detail form relabels Agent → Sidekick and adds safer image uploads with inline status; embed modal styling is darker with blur; chat embed streaming now scrolls intelligently so responses start at the top without jumping.
