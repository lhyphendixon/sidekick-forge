# Multi-Tenant Integration Summary

## ✅ Completed Integration Steps

### 1. Database Setup
- ✅ Created `clients` table in Sidekick Forge platform database
- ✅ Inserted Autonomite as the first client (ID: 11389177-e4d8-49a9-9a00-f77bb4de6592)
- ✅ Verified platform database connectivity

### 2. Core Services Implemented
- ✅ **ClientConnectionManager** (`/app/services/client_connection_manager.py`)
  - Manages multi-tenant database connections
  - Routes requests to correct client databases
  - No fallbacks - fails fast with clear errors

- ✅ **Multi-tenant AgentService** (`/app/services/agent_service_multitenant.py`)
  - Full CRUD operations with tenant isolation
  - Auto-detection of client from agent slug
  - Connects to client's Supabase for agent data

- ✅ **Multi-tenant ClientService** (`/app/services/client_service_multitenant.py`)
  - Manages clients in platform database
  - Handles API keys and credentials
  - Uses simplified PlatformClient model

### 3. API Endpoints Created
- ✅ **Trigger Endpoint** (`/app/api/v1/trigger_multitenant.py`)
  - Supports both voice and text modes
  - Auto-detects client from agent slug
  - Passes all API keys to agent workers

- ✅ **Agent Endpoints** (`/app/api/v1/agents_multitenant.py`)
  - GET /agents?client_id=<uuid>
  - GET /agents/{slug}
  - POST/PUT/DELETE with client isolation

- ✅ **Client Endpoints** (`/app/api/v1/clients_multitenant.py`)
  - Full CRUD for platform clients
  - API key management
  - Sync from client databases

### 4. Models Created
- ✅ **PlatformClient Model** (`/app/models/platform_client.py`)
  - Simplified model for platform database
  - Stores client credentials and API keys
  - No complex nested requirements

### 5. Integration with Main App
- ✅ Added v2 routes to main.py for gradual migration
- ✅ Routes available at `/api/v2/*` alongside existing v1
- ✅ Backward compatible - no breaking changes

## 🧪 Test Results

### Platform Services Test
```
✅ Platform Connection: Successfully connected to Sidekick Forge database
✅ Multi-tenant Services: Retrieved Autonomite client and 8 agents
✅ API Endpoints: Health check passed
```

### What Works
1. **ClientConnectionManager** successfully routes to client databases
2. **AgentService** retrieves agents from Autonomite's Supabase
3. **ClientService** manages platform clients correctly
4. Full tenant isolation is maintained

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Restart FastAPI Server**
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart fastapi
   ```
   This will load the new v2 endpoints.

2. **Test V2 Endpoints**
   ```bash
   python3 /root/autonomite-agent-platform/scripts/test_v2_endpoints.py
   ```

3. **Update WordPress Plugin**
   - Test with client_id as UUID: `11389177-e4d8-49a9-9a00-f77bb4de6592`
   - Use v2 endpoints for multi-tenant support
   - v1 endpoints continue to work for backward compatibility

### Migration Path

#### Phase 1: Testing (Current)
- v2 endpoints available alongside v1
- Test with Autonomite client UUID
- Monitor for any issues

#### Phase 2: Gradual Migration
- Update WordPress plugin to detect UUID client_ids
- Route UUID requests to v2, others to v1
- Add more clients to platform database

#### Phase 3: Full Migration
- Migrate all clients to platform database
- Update all endpoints to use multi-tenant services
- Remove legacy single-tenant code

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
The `.env` file now contains Sidekick Forge platform credentials:
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://eukudpgfpihxsypulopm.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<platform_key>
```

### Client Credentials
Each client's credentials are stored in the platform database:
- Supabase URL and service role key
- LiveKit credentials (if custom)
- All API keys for AI services

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Complete Tenant Isolation**: Each client's data is physically separated
2. **Dynamic Configuration**: API keys loaded from database, not environment
3. **No More Key Conflicts**: Platform credentials separate from client credentials
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Add unlimited clients without code changes
5. **Fail-Fast Design**: Configuration errors immediately visible

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **No Fallbacks**: The system will fail with clear errors rather than use defaults
2. **UUID Required**: Multi-tenant mode requires UUID client IDs
3. **Backward Compatible**: Existing v1 endpoints continue to work
4. **Manual Restart**: Server must be restarted to load new routes

The multi-tenant architecture is now ready for testing and gradual rollout!
