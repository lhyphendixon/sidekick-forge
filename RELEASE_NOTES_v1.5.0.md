# Release v1.5.0 - RAG Context Injection Fix

## 🔧 RAG Enhancement Release

This release fixes the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) context injection in voice agents.

### 🐛 Bug Fixed
- Voice agents were not injecting RAG context into LLM responses
- Agent could not answer questions about courses or knowledge base content

### ✨ Solution
- Switched to `session_agent_rag_enhanced.py` with proper RAG context injection
- Implemented `RAGEnhancedLLM` wrapper that intercepts and enhances LLM calls
- Properly separated base LLM (for VoiceAgent) and enhanced LLM (for AgentSession)

### 📝 Changes
- Updated agent runtime to use enhanced RAG implementation
- Fixed mission critical tests for new log formats
- Added comprehensive documentation of changes

### 🔍 Technical Details
The RAGEnhancedLLM wrapper:
1. Intercepts chat requests
2. Extracts user questions
3. Retrieves relevant context from RAG system
4. Injects context as system messages
5. Passes enhanced conversation to base LLM

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- Full end-to-end testing with production course queries is still pending
- Additional tuning may be needed for optimal context retrieval

### 🐳 Docker Image
New image tag: `autonomite/agent-runtime:rag-context-fixed`

### 📄 Files Changed
- `scripts/test_mission_critical.py` - Fixed test bugs and updated log patterns
- `RAG_ENHANCEMENT_CHANGES.md` - Detailed technical documentation

### 🚀 Deployment Notes
To deploy this fix:
1. Update your container manager to use `autonomite/agent-runtime:rag-context-fixed`
2. Ensure your agent runtime uses `session_agent_rag_enhanced.py`
3. Restart your agent containers
