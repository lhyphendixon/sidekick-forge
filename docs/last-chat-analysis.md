## Issues Found

### 1. Agent Shows "Found user profile: Unknown" ❌
**Symptom**: Despite user profile existing with `full_name: "leandrew"`, agent shows "Unknown"
**Root Cause**: Agent container running 10-hour-old code that doesn't include the fix for checking multiple name fields
**Evidence**: 
- Profile query returns: `{"full_name": "leandrew", "email": "l-dixon@autonomite.net", ...}`
- Agent logs show: `"Found user profile: Unknown"`
- Agent image is 10 hours old: `sidekick-forge/agent-runtime latest e7182ba4503e 10 hours ago`

### 2. Document RAG Returns 0 Results ❌
**Symptom**: Agent can't find any documents despite 11 documents being assigned
**Root Cause**: Same - agent container using old code
**Evidence**:
- Direct query shows 11 documents assigned to Clarence Coherence
- Agent logs show: `"Found 0 documents for agent"`
- Test script confirms documents exist and are properly assigned

### 3. Correct Client ID Being Used ✅
**Evidence**: Logs show client ID `11389177-e4d8-49a9-9a00-f77bb4de6592` consistently
- Platform correctly loads Autonomite client
- Agent receives correct client_id in metadata
- Context manager uses correct client_id

### 4. Correct User ID Being Used ✅
**Evidence**: Logs show user ID `351bb07b-03fc-4fb4-b09b-748ef8a72084` consistently
- Trigger endpoint receives correct user_id
- Agent metadata includes correct user_id
- Context manager queries with correct user_id

## What's Working

1. **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Client and User IDs flow correctly through the system
2. **Database Connections**: Platform correctly connects to client's Supabase
3. **Profile Data**: User profile exists with name "leandrew"
4. **Document Assignments**: 11 documents properly assigned to Clarence Coherence
5. **API Keys**: Successfully loaded from platform database

## What's Not Working

1. **Stale Agent Container**: Running 10-hour-old code without recent fixes
2. **Name Field Detection**: Old code doesn't check `full_name` field
3. **Document Loading**: Old code may have issues with agent_documents query

## Solution

**Rebuild and restart the agent container**:
```bash
# Stop current agent
docker-compose stop agent-worker

# Rebuild with latest code
docker-compose build agent-worker

# Start fresh
docker-compose up -d agent-worker
```

## Expected Results After Fix

1. Agent will show: `"Found user profile: leandrew"`
2. Agent will find 11 documents for Coherence Education
3. Agent will have proper context about the user and their documents
4. Agent will be able to answer questions about Coherence Education classes

## Timeline

1. **10 hours ago**: Agent container last built
2. **Since then**: Fixed multiple issues including:
   - Added `full_name` field check in context.py
   - Updated client ID references
   - Fixed various ID hardcoding issues
3. **Now**: Need to deploy these fixes by rebuilding container
