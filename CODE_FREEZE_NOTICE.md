# CODE FREEZE NOTICE - Agent Worker System

**Effective Date**: January 24, 2025  
**Duration**: Temporary (estimated completion within 24 hours)

## IMPORTANT: Agent Worker Code Freeze in Effect

A code freeze is now in effect for all agent worker-related code to allow for critical codebase unification work.

### Affected Areas:
- `/root/autonomite-agent-platform/docker/agent/`
- `/opt/autonomite-saas/agent-runtime/`
- Any LiveKit agent implementations
- Agent worker Docker configurations

### Restrictions:
- ❌ NO new features for agent workers
- ❌ NO non-critical bug fixes to agent code
- ❌ NO modifications to agent Docker images
- ✅ Critical production fixes only (with team approval)

### Reason:
We are unifying two divergent agent codebases to establish a single source of truth and resolve architectural inconsistencies.

### Work in Progress:
- Branch: `feature/unify-agent-codebase`
- Lead: Development Team
- Tracking: See todo items #38-40

### Contact:
For urgent issues or questions about this freeze, please contact the development team immediately.

This notice will be removed once the unification is complete.
