# Sidekick Forge Migration Summary

## Migration Completed Successfully ✅

The project has been successfully migrated from `autonomite-agent-platform` to `sidekick-forge`.

### What Was Done:

1. **Directory Structure**
   - Created new directory: `/root/sidekick-forge`
   - Backed up original: `/root/autonomite-agent-platform.backup`
   - Created symlink for compatibility: `/root/autonomite-agent-platform` → `/root/sidekick-forge`

2. **Updated References**
   - All Python files updated to use new paths
   - Docker configurations updated with dynamic naming
   - Systemd service file updated to new paths
   - Fixed dependency conflicts in requirements.txt

3. **Dynamic Domain Configuration**
   - Added environment variables: `DOMAIN_NAME`, `APP_NAME`, `PLATFORM_NAME`
   - Created nginx template for any domain
   - Updated application to load domain from environment

4. **Files Updated**
   - `/etc/systemd/system/sidekick-forge-fastapi.service`
   - `/root/sidekick-forge/docker-compose.yml`
   - `/root/sidekick-forge/docker/docker-compose.production.yml`
   - `/root/sidekick-forge/requirements.txt`
   - `/root/CLAUDE.md`
   - Multiple Python files with agent references

### Next Steps:

1. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   cd /root/sidekick-forge
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Deploy to sidekickforge.com**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh sidekickforge.com
   ```

3. **Update DNS**
   - Point sidekickforge.com to your server IP
   - Wait for DNS propagation

4. **SSL Certificate**
   - Run deployment script and choose 'y' for SSL
   - Or manually: `./scripts/setup-ssl.sh`

### Important Notes:

- The old directory is backed up at `/root/autonomite-agent-platform.backup`
- A symlink maintains backward compatibility
- All services now use dynamic naming based on environment variables
- The platform is now domain-agnostic and can be deployed anywhere

### Client Data:
- Autonomite remains as a client in the multi-tenant system
- No client data was modified during migration
- All client configurations remain intact
