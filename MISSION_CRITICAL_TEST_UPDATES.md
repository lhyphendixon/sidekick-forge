# Mission Critical Test Updates Summary

## Files Updated

### 1. `/root/autonomite-agent-platform/scripts/test_mission_critical_v2.py`
**Updated with new verification features:**

- **Deployment Verification** (`test_deployment_verification`):
  - Checks if session_agent.py is actually deployed in containers
  - Verifies event handlers are registered
  - Detects stuck processes
  - Collects runtime proof of deployment status

- **Greeting Verification** (`test_greeting_verification`):
  - Tracks greeting attempts vs successes
  - Calculates success rate
  - Monitors audio track publishing
  - No false positives for containers that haven't tried greetings yet

- **Container Health Monitoring** (`test_container_health_monitoring`):
  - Real-time CPU and memory metrics
  - Network usage tracking
  - Container restart detection
  - Health status monitoring

- **Room-Specific Processing** (`test_room_specific_processing`):
  - Verifies agent processes the exact room requested
  - Confirms job acceptance for specific rooms
  - Ensures no cross-contamination between rooms

- **Runtime Proof Collection**:
  - Stores all evidence in `self.runtime_proof` dictionary
  - Prints detailed runtime proof in summary
  - Includes evidence in test results

### 2. `/root/autonomite-agent-platform/scripts/test_mission_critical_enhanced.py`
**New comprehensive test suite with full runtime proof features:**

- **Comprehensive Deployment Verification**:
  - Checks deployment scripts existence
  - Verifies container labels and metadata
  - Inspects deployed code inside containers
  - Counts errors and stuck processes

- **Greeting Runtime Proof**:
  - Triggers test rooms for each container
  - Waits for processing and collects evidence
  - Extracts actual greeting messages
  - Verifies complete flow from trigger to greeting

- **Build and Deployment Pipeline**:
  - Checks Docker buildx availability
  - Monitors build cache size
  - Reads last deployment records
  - Calculates deployment age

- **Container Performance Metrics**:
  - Detailed CPU, memory, network statistics
  - Container uptime tracking
  - Restart count monitoring
  - Health status verification

- **Runtime Proof Report Generation**:
  - Saves comprehensive JSON report to `/tmp/mission_critical_runtime_proof.json`
  - Includes all test results with evidence
  - Provides categorized runtime proof data
  - Timestamps all operations

## Key Features Added

1. **No More Assumptions** - Every claim is backed by runtime evidence
2. **Container Inspection** - Direct verification of deployed code
3. **Performance Monitoring** - Real-time resource usage tracking
4. **Deployment Verification** - Confirms actual code is running
5. **Greeting Success Tracking** - Measures actual success rates
6. **Health Monitoring** - Detects stuck processes and errors
7. **Evidence Collection** - JSON reports with full proof
8. **Room-Specific Testing** - Ensures correct room processing

## Usage

### Standard Mission Critical Test (Updated):
```bash
python3 /root/autonomite-agent-platform/scripts/test_mission_critical_v2.py
```

### Enhanced Runtime Proof Test:
```bash
python3 /root/autonomite-agent-platform/scripts/test_mission_critical_enhanced.py
```

### Quick Mode (v2 only):
```bash
python3 /root/autonomite-agent-platform/scripts/test_mission_critical_v2.py --quick
```

## Runtime Proof Location

After running enhanced tests, find detailed runtime proof at:
- `/tmp/mission_critical_runtime_proof.json`

## What These Tests Catch

1. **Deployment Issues**:
   - Wrong agent running (minimal_agent.py vs session_agent.py)
   - Missing event handlers
   - Code not actually deployed

2. **Runtime Problems**:
   - Stuck processes
   - Container restarts
   - High resource usage
   - Health check failures

3. **Functional Issues**:
   - Greetings not being sent
   - Audio tracks not published
   - Wrong rooms being processed
   - Job dispatch failures

4. **Performance Issues**:
   - High CPU/memory usage
   - Network bottlenecks
   - Container instability

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests can be integrated into deployment pipelines:

```bash
# Deploy and verify
./scripts/deploy_agent.sh && \
python3 ./scripts/test_mission_critical_enhanced.py && \
echo "Deployment verified!" || echo "Deployment failed verification!"
```

## Summary

The mission critical tests now provide:
- **Runtime Proof** - No more unverified claims
- **Deployment Verification** - Confirms actual code is running
- **Performance Monitoring** - Catches resource issues
- **Comprehensive Evidence** - JSON reports with all data
- **Automated Validation** - Can be used in CI/CD pipelines

These updates directly address all issues raised by the oversight agent, ensuring we have empirical evidence for all system operations.
