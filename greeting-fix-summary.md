# Greeting Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

The greeting functionality in `minimal_agent.py` was not working properly. The issue was:

1. **Original Problem**: Greeting was sent in `on_enter()` method before the agent session was ready
2. **Symptoms**: 
   - Log showed "Greeting sent" but no audio was transmitted
   - No audio track was published when greeting was attempted
   - No participants were in the room when greeting was sent

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `on_enter()` method
```python
async def on_enter(self) -> None:
    """Called when agent starts"""
    logger.info("🚀 Agent entering - on_enter() called")
    
    # Don't send greeting here - session not ready yet
    # Greeting will be sent after session starts
```

### 2. Added greeting after session starts
```python
# Start the agent session
await session.start(room=ctx.room, agent=agent)
logger.info("✅ Agent session started successfully")

# Send greeting after session is ready
await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
greeting = "Hello! I'm a minimal test agent. I can hear you and respond."

if len(ctx.room.remote_participants) > 0:
    logger.info(f"👥 {len(ctx.room.remote_participants)} participant(s) in room, sending greeting...")
    await agent.send_greeting(greeting)
else:
    logger.info("👥 No participants in room yet, skipping greeting")
```

### 3. Added participant join handler
```python
@ctx.room.on("participant_connected")
def on_participant_connected(participant):
    # ... existing logging ...
    
    async def send_delayed_greeting():
        await asyncio.sleep(1.0)
        if hasattr(agent, '_agent_session') and agent._agent_session:
            greeting = f"Hello {participant.name or participant.identity}! I'm a minimal test agent..."
            logger.info(f"🎤 Sending greeting to {participant.identity}")
            await agent.send_greeting(greeting)
    
    asyncio.create_task(send_delayed_greeting())
```

## Deployment Status

1. ✅ Fixed code written to `/opt/autonomite-saas/agent-runtime/minimal_agent.py`
2. ✅ Built new Docker image: `autonomite/agent-runtime:greeting-fix-v2`
3. ✅ Updated container manager to use fixed image
4. ⚠️  Cannot fully test greeting functionality due to underlying job dispatch issue

## Current Blocker

The greeting fix is implemented but cannot be fully tested because:
- Agent containers register with LiveKit successfully
- But jobs are not being dispatched to the agents
- This prevents the agent from joining rooms and processing voice

## Next Steps

To complete the greeting fix verification:
1. Resolve the job dispatch issue (agents not receiving jobs from LiveKit)
2. Test with a participant joining the room
3. Verify greeting is heard by participants
