# Final Cleanup Complete âœ…

## Remaining Issues Fixed

### Fixed Python Files (3 files)
All hardcoded references to `/root/autonomite-agent-platform` have been updated to `/root/sidekick-forge`:

1. **`/root/fix_agent_loading.py`**
   - Updated: `sys.path.insert(0, '/root/sidekick-forge')`
   - This was a test script in the root directory

2. **`/root/test_client_retrieval.py`**
   - Updated: `sys.path.insert(0, '/root/sidekick-forge')`
   - This was a test script in the root directory

3. **`/root/test_embedding_flow.py`**
   - Updated: `sys.path.insert(0, '/root/sidekick-forge')`
   - This was a test script in the root directory

### Verification Complete
- No remaining references to `/root/autonomite-agent-platform` in any Python files
- All paths now correctly point to `/root/sidekick-forge`
- Migration is 100% complete

### Note
These three files were test/utility scripts located in the root directory (`/root/`), not in the project directory. They appear to be development/debugging scripts that were created during troubleshooting.
