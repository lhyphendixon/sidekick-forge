# Unified Transactional Conversation Storage Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a unified, transactional turn-based storage system for both voice and text conversations. This replaces the old batch storage model with immediate storage after each conversation turn.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Storage Helper Function (`/root/sidekick-forge/app/api/v1/trigger.py`)

Added `_store_conversation_turn()` helper that:
- Stores conversation turns immediately in the client's Supabase
- Works for both text and voice conversations
- Includes metadata about storage version and source
- Handles errors gracefully without breaking the conversation

### 2. Text Chat Storage (`handle_text_trigger`)

- Integrated storage after LLM response generation
- Creates Supabase client using client credentials
- Stores turn with user message and agent response
- Marks source as "text"

### 3. Voice Agent Storage (`/root/sidekick-forge/docker/agent/entrypoint.py`)

- Added `_store_voice_turn()` helper function
- Integrated with LiveKit event handlers:
  - `user_speech_committed`: Captures user message
  - `agent_speech_committed`: Pairs with user message and stores turn
- Uses async task to avoid blocking conversation flow
- Marks source as "voice"

## Database Schema

All conversations use the same `conversation_transcripts` table:
```sql
{
  "user_id": "string",
  "agent_id": "string", 
  "conversation_id": "string",
  "user_message": "string",
  "assistant_message": "string",
  "turn_timestamp": "timestamp",
  "source": "text|voice",
  "metadata": {
    "stored_immediately": true,
    "storage_version": "v2_transactional"
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Availability**: Conversations are immediately available for RAG
2. **Unified Storage**: Single table for all conversation types
3. **Better Reliability**: No risk of losing data at session end
4. **Simplified Architecture**: No batch processing or Redis dependency
5. **Cross-modal Context**: Text and voice conversations share context

## RAG Integration

The existing RAG system (`match_conversation_transcripts_secure`) works seamlessly with the new storage:
- Searches across all conversations (text and voice)
- No changes needed to RAG queries
- Immediate context availability for subsequent turns

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite at `/root/sidekick-forge/scripts/test_unified_storage.py` that:
- Tests text conversation storage
- Simulates voice conversation flow
- Verifies unified storage model
- Confirms RAG readiness

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code
2. Monitor storage logs for both modalities
3. Verify RAG context includes recent conversations
4. Test cross-modal conversation continuity
5. Consider adding conversation embeddings for similarity search
