# RAG Text Chat Fix Summary

## Critical Issue Addressed

The oversight review identified that text chat was **bypassing the RAG system entirely**, making direct HTTP calls to LLM providers without any context awareness. This has been **completely fixed**.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Complete Refactor of `handle_text_trigger`

**Before (OLD - REMOVED):**
- Direct HTTP calls to Groq/OpenAI APIs using `httpx`
- No context awareness or RAG integration
- No access to conversation history or user profiles
- "Dumb" responses without memory

**After (NEW - IMPLEMENTED):**
- Full integration with `AgentContextManager`
- Uses `ContextAwareLLM` wrapper for dynamic context injection
- Access to conversation history via RAG
- User profile awareness
- Document search capability
- Proper LLM plugin usage (livekit.plugins)

### 2. Module Organization

Created `/root/sidekick-forge/app/agent_modules/` containing:
- `context.py` - AgentContextManager for RAG operations
- `llm_wrapper.py` - ContextAwareLLM for context injection
- `api_key_loader.py` - Dynamic API key loading
- `config_validator.py` - Configuration validation

### 3. Key Features of New Implementation

1. **Context Manager Initialization:**
   - Creates Supabase client for the client's database
   - Initializes AgentContextManager with proper credentials
   - Configures embedding providers dynamically

2. **LLM Configuration:**
   - Uses LiveKit plugin system (groq.LLM, openai.LLM)
   - Proper API key validation
   - Model name mapping for compatibility

3. **RAG Integration:**
   - Builds initial context with user profile
   - Wraps LLM with ContextAwareLLM
   - Dynamic context injection on each request
   - Full conversation history search

4. **Storage Integration:**
   - Stores conversation turns immediately after response
   - Same transactional model as voice chat
   - Unified storage schema

### 4. Error Handling

- Graceful fallback if no context manager available
- Proper error messages for missing API keys
- Storage failures don't break the response
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Testing

Created test script at `/root/sidekick-forge/scripts/test_rag_text_chat.py` that:
- Sends contextual messages
- Verifies memory recall
- Tests RAG functionality
- Validates context persistence

## Result

Text chat now has **full parity with voice chat**:
- ✅ RAG-powered responses
- ✅ Conversation history awareness
- ✅ User profile integration
- ✅ Document search capability
- ✅ Transactional storage
- ✅ Unified architecture

The critical flaw has been completely resolved. Text chat is no longer "dumb" - it has full access to the agent's memory and context system.
