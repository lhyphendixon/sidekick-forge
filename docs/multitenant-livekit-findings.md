# Multi-Tenant LiveKit Implementation Findings

## Summary

Based on the oversight feedback and investigation, I've implemented changes to restore proper multi-tenant isolation for LiveKit credentials. The key finding is that **LiveKit Cloud DOES support external workers**, contrary to my initial misdiagnosis.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Created Client-Specific LiveKit Manager (`/opt/autonomite-saas/app/services/livekit_client_manager.py`)
- New function `get_client_livekit_manager()` creates LiveKit managers with client-specific credentials
- Ensures each client uses their own LiveKit Cloud account for billing and logging isolation

### 2. Updated Trigger Endpoint (`/opt/autonomite-saas/app/api/v1/trigger.py`)
- Modified `handle_voice_trigger()` to use client-specific LiveKit credentials for:
  - Room creation
  - Token generation
  - Agent dispatch
- Changed from using `backend_livekit` to `client_livekit` throughout
- Fixed the `use_backend_livekit` parameter to `False` for clarity

### 3. Container Credential Passing
- Containers receive client-specific LiveKit credentials via environment variables
- Agent runtime properly authenticates with client's LiveKit Cloud instance

## Current Configuration Issue

The test client (ID: `df91fd06-816f-4273-a903-5a4861277040`) is currently configured with the SAME LiveKit credentials as the backend:
- Server URL: `wss://litebridge-hw6srhvi.livekit.cloud`
- API Key: `APIUtuiQ47BQBsk`
- API Secret: (matches backend)

This prevents full testing of multi-tenant isolation.

## Requirements for True Multi-Tenant Isolation

1. **Each client MUST have their own LiveKit Cloud project** with unique:
   - Server URL (different LiveKit Cloud instance)
   - API Key
   - API Secret

2. **Benefits of proper isolation:**
   - Per-client billing - each client pays for their own usage
   - Separate logging - client activities are isolated
   - Easy migration - clients can move to self-hosted LiveKit later
   - Security - no cross-client data access

3. **To configure a client properly:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE clients 
   SET settings = jsonb_set(
       settings,
       '{livekit}',
       '{
           "server_url": "wss://client-specific.livekit.cloud",
           "api_key": "APIClientSpecific123",
           "api_secret": "ClientSecretKey456"
       }'::jsonb
   )
   WHERE id = 'client-id-here';
   ```

## Architecture Clarification

The correct multi-tenant architecture is:
- **Backend LiveKit account**: Used only for backend administrative tasks (if any)
- **Client LiveKit accounts**: Each client has their own LiveKit Cloud project
- **Room creation**: Uses client's LiveKit credentials
- **Agent connection**: Uses client's LiveKit credentials
- **User tokens**: Generated with client's LiveKit credentials

This ensures complete isolation between clients while maintaining the thin-client architecture where the backend orchestrates everything but uses client-specific resources.

## Next Steps

1. Create separate LiveKit Cloud projects for each client
2. Update client configurations with unique credentials
3. Test that agents connect to the correct LiveKit instance
4. Verify billing and logging isolation
