# Context System Implementation - Corrected per "No Fallbacks" Policy

## Overview

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) context system has been completely rewritten to strictly adhere to the "No Fallbacks" policy from CLAUDE.md. All workarounds and fallback strategies have been removed in favor of clean, fail-fast implementations.

## Key Changes

### 1. Complete Removal of Fallback Strategies ✅

**Before**: The system had 5 different fallback strategies for document search and multiple fallbacks for conversation search.

**After**: The system now uses ONLY the correct RPC functions:
- `match_documents` for knowledge RAG
- `match_conversation_transcripts_secure` for conversation RAG

### 2. Simplified Implementation ✅

**_gather_knowledge_rag**:
```python
# NO FALLBACKS: Only use the correct RPC function
result = self.supabase.rpc("match_documents", {
    "p_query_embedding": query_embedding,
    "p_agent_slug": agent_slug,
    "p_match_threshold": 0.5,
    "p_match_count": 5
}).execute()
```

**_gather_conversation_rag**:
```python
# NO FALLBACKS: Only use the correct RPC function
result = self.supabase.rpc("match_conversation_transcripts_secure", {
    "query_embeddings": query_embedding,
    "agent_slug_param": self.agent_config.get("slug"),
    "user_id_param": self.user_id,
    "match_count": 5
}).execute()
```

### 3. Schema Detection Removed ✅

The `_detect_schema` method no longer tests for table/function existence. The system assumes required functions exist and fails fast with clear errors if they don't.

### 4. Helper Methods Simplified ✅

Removed complex helper methods that implemented fallbacks:
- `_process_documents_with_embeddings` - REMOVED
- `_process_document_chunks` - REMOVED
- `_format_match_documents_results` - Now just returns data as-is

## Architectural Principles Followed

1. **No Workarounds**: The system no longer tries to work around missing or broken SQL functions
2. **Fail Fast**: If RPC functions don't exist or fail, exceptions are raised immediately
3. **Clear Errors**: Users get explicit error messages about what's wrong
4. **Single Source of Truth**: SQL functions are the only way to search for documents/conversations

## Current State

The application code is now correct and follows all architectural principles. However, it will NOT work until the SQL functions are properly implemented in Supabase.

## Next Steps

1. Database team must implement the SQL functions as documented in `SQL_FIXES_NEEDED.md`
2. No application code changes are needed once the SQL functions exist
3. The system will start working immediately once the database is fixed

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Simpler Code**: ~200 lines of fallback code removed
- **Better Security**: Data isolation enforced at database level
- **Easier Debugging**: Single point of failure makes issues obvious
- **Better Performance**: Optimized SQL queries instead of in-memory processing
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation between application and database logic
